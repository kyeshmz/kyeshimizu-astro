<p>
Algorithmic Couture is a project aiming to automate the creation of zero waste fashion patterns and digitize traditional haute couture techniques to create customized ethical fashion garments. Through the collaboration of fashion designers, machine learning engineers, and digital fabrication specialists, our goal is to revitalize the production system of fashion design for a more sustainable future. The project at its core consists of 3 main concepts; Firstly sustainability, through changing a polluting industry through zero waste fashion design. Secondly digitization, through digitizing traditional haute couture techniques into parameters for an automated digital fabrication production system. Lastly customization, through the mass customization of bespoke garments, providing an area of co-creation with customers the ability through the use of parameters over designs that would be generated from their body data.</p>
