    We explored continuous changes in self-other identity by designing an interpersonal facial
    morphing experience where the facial images of two users are blended and then swapped over time.
    Both users’ facial images are displayed side by side, with each user controlling their own
    morphing facial images, allowing us to create and investigate a multifaceted interpersonal
    experience. To explore this with diverse social relationships, we conducted qualitative and
    quantitative investigations through public exhibitions. We found that there is a window of
    self-identification as well as a variety of interpersonal experiences in the facial morphing
    process. From these insights, we synthesized a Self-Other Continuum represented by a sense of
    agency and facial identity. This continuum has implications in terms of the social and
    subjective aspects of interpersonal communication, which enables further scenario design and
    could complement findings from research on interactive devices for remote communication.

    Where is the boundary of self? How do we feel and interact with each other? We explored
    continuous changes in self-other identity by designing an interpersonal facial morphing
    experience where the facial images of two users are blended and then swapped over time.

    With Morphing Identity system, two users' facial images are displayed side by side, with each
    user controlling their own morphing facial images, allowing us to create and investigate a
    multifaceted interpersonal experience.

    To explore this with diverse social relationships, we conducted qualitative and quantitative investigations through public exhibitions, beyond the lab environment.
