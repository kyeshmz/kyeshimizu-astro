The origin of this work, "100% Tokyo" (2013), was a live awareness survey theater for 100 citizens collected based on the demographics of Tokyo at that time.

Inspired by this, this work is an experiential exhibition in which the viewer becomes a sample to construct his or her own statistics. Behind the questions that divide the majority and minority groups, a pseudo-society is revealed.

When answers that are not part of the majority appear before your eyes accompanied by your body, you are made aware of the fact that a 100% yes or no is almost impossible to achieve. In the present time, when the social environment has changed due to the new coronavirus, and various structural discriminations have begun to be revealed, we will look down on the boundaries that separate us from others and our position as a relative existence.
