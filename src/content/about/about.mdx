Kye Shimizu is an interface designer and research engineer that works with different mediums to explore existing boundaries across different fields. His focus is to explore how computational technologies alongside mediums of expression can help facilitate understanding of how we perceive ourselves, in areas of communication, expression, and identity. He is a strong believer in doing things “in the wild”, to be able to observe and explore research that cannot be discovered in traditional experiment settings. Excited to present in different situations, his works has been exhibited around the globe in institutions such as HeK Basel (Switzerland) , Ars Electronica (Austria), and Miraikan (Japan). Furthermore, he is a strong communicator of his work, publishing and presented works in academic conferences such as CHI and SIGGRAPH, as well as in other venues of design such as Design Indaba and Paris Fashion Week.
