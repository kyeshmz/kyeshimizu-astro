This project aims to explore the possibilities of “urban compositions” by means of mashing up urban landscapes through the algorithmic sonication process using object detection software. As the modern city has various elements (e.g. nature, buildings, and human activities), by generating sounds through the eyes of machines, we aim to aurally re-represent alternative cityscapes. Our question is how unique sounds and spaces would be created by applying urban complexity in the field of audiovisual composition.
