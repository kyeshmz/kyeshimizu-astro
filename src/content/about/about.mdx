I am an technical artist and research engineer that loves to build with code. I'm a fierce advocate of being a translator or ‚Äúinterface‚Äù between ideas and people not often in dialogue. By cross referencing academic research alongside practical applications in the field, I aim to make things that make people laugh, envision possibilities, and build new tools for others.

I love doing things "in the wild", to be able to observe and explore research that cannot be discovered in traditional experiment settings. But quite frankly, I might just be bored of white walled museums and hyper controlled experiments.

I was previously a contractor working with GAFAM companies, as well as the founder of Synflux, a company building computational fashion software.

I am currently based in Japan, but I lived in America for quite a while
