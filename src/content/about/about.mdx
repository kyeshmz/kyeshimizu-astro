Kye Shimizu is an interface designer and research engineer that works with different mediums to explore existing boundaries across different fields.

By cross referencing academic research alongside practical applications in the field, he aims to make people laugh, envision possibilities, and build tools for new inventions.

He is a strong believer in doing things “in the wild”, to be able to observe and explore research that cannot be discovered in traditional experiment settings.
By researching and exploring the possibilities of new technologies and paradigms, he aims to tell untold stories.
