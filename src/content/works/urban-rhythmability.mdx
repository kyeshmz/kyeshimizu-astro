    "Urban Rhythmability" is a work that explores the structural rhythmicity of the city and plays
    music with the rhythm of the city. The project begins by filming every aspect of the Roppongi
    landscape from the TOKYO CITY VIEW on the 52nd floor of Roppongi Hills Mori Tower. Using a
    machine learning program, it detects the movement of objects in Roppongi (people, cars, trains,
    traffic lights, etc.) and generates rhythms from these objects, which are then used as notes on
    a musical score. The rhythms, the environmental sounds collected by field recording in Roppongi,
    and the musical sounds are then used as equal parts to compose a piece of music that can be
    played by the city of Roppongi. as a collaborative work by Synflux and HATRA.
