Held during the darkest time of the year in Helsinki, Finland, Slush has always been characterized by a unique energy and enthusiasm. The very core of Slush is to facilitate founder and investor meetings and to build a world-wide startup community.

Slush is a student-driven, non-profit movement originally founded to change attitudes toward entrepreneurship.

Slush Asia 2015 was the first Slush event held in Asia. It was held in Tokyo, Japan. As part of the core organizing team, I was responsible for overseeing all production and logistics for the Slush Asia conference.

With over 3,000 attendees, 250 startups, 30 speakers, and 100 investors, executing a smooth event required meticulous planning and coordination across vendors, partners, and staff.

Through bringing together change makers, key industry players and different community builders together, we create a thriving startup ecosystem under one roof.
