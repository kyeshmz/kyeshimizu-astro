  This project aims to explore the possibilities of “urban compositions” by means of mashing up
  urban landscapes through the algorithmic sonication process using object detection software. As
  the modern city has various elements (e.g. nature, buildings, and human activities), by generating
  sounds through the eyes of machines, we aim to aurally re-represent alternative cityscapes. Our
  question is how unique sounds and spaces would be created by applying urban complexity in the
  field of audiovisual composition.
